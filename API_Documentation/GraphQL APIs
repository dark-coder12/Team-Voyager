GraphQL is not just an architecture, it is a complete query language. It gives a very understandable representation of the data accessed by the API of your choice, with the major difference from REST being that it allows it's users to fetch only what they desire. The results are always reliable and to the point. GraphQL can also be integrated with complex developer tools.

While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL gets all of the required data through a single URL, and thus offers greater speeds.
