GitHub’s User Interface Design

GitHub does not use heavy frameworks for it’s front-end such as Angular or Vue, instead it makes use of Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, or personalized Components. 

Background

Upon extensive research, it was found that GitHub originally (2007) made use of simple JavaScript using jQuery for its frontend, but with time it reverted back to the simplicity of vanilla JS. According to GitHub’s official blog: 

“As part of our refined approach to building frontend features on GitHub.com, we focused on getting away with regular HTML foundation as much as we could, and only adding JavaScript behaviors as progressive enhancement. As a result, even those web forms and other UI elements that were enhanced using JS would usually also work with JavaScript disabled in the browser. In some cases, we were able to delete certain legacy behaviors altogether instead of having to rewrite them in vanilla JS.”

GitHub states in their blog that they strive to keep their frontend lightweight, fast and accessible.

Web Components 

Web Components is a vast term, and by this GitHub mainly refers to customized code they’ve established using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These components offer portability as well as encapsulation.

One of the first two custom elements would be : <relative-time> and <local-time>. Both of these are used to show date and time in a more friendly format, and GitHub can reuse them anytime needed. Such components range from generic purpose such as <remote-input> to <markdown-toolbar>.
Remote Input: This is used to get values from input fields and send it to a server.
Markdown Toolbar: This is used to format buttons.


A real time example of Task List Elements (A component made by GitHub)


A coding example found from GitHub’s repository
<task-lists> element
Installation: $ npm install --save @github/task-lists-element

Import: import '@github/task-lists-element'

Markup: 
<task-lists sortable>
  <ul class="contains-task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item">
      <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox">
      Hubot
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
      <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox">
      Bender
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="contains-task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item">
      <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox">
      BB-8
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
      <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox">
      WALL-E
    </li>
  </ul>
</task-lists>

Events:
const list = document.querySelector('task-lists')

list.addEventListener('task-lists-check', function(event) {
  const {position, checked} = event.detail
  console.log(position, checked)
})

list.addEventListener('task-lists-move', function(event) {
  const {src, dst} = event.detail
  console.log(src, dst)
})

Development:
npm install
npm test

Functionality of the frontend features - in JavaScript:

The following source code is for initializing task element actions (i.e. dragging). GitHub has created open source code for utilizing task items functionality, much similar to a to-do list. This list also allows nesting and dragging rows. 
       
 By examining the initItem function

First of all, the function checks if the task element is not already initialized, and if not, it initializes it. It also checks whether the current task item to be added is an instance object of the same web component or not, or else it returns from the function. In case a single item exists, since it is not draggable, it returns as well. If all conditions are satisfied mouse movement actions are applied on events like mouse over or mouse out.

// Only top-level lists are draggable, and nested lists drag with their parent item.
function initItem(el: HTMLElement) {
  if (initialized.get(el)) return
  initialized.set(el, true)

  const currentTaskList = el.closest('task-lists')
  if (!(currentTaskList instanceof TaskListsElement)) return

  // Single item task lists are not draggable.
  if (currentTaskList.querySelectorAll('.task-list-item').length <= 1) return

  const fragment = handleTemplate.content.cloneNode(true)
  const handle = (fragment as DocumentFragment).querySelector<HTMLElement>('.handle')
  el.prepend(fragment)

  if (!handle) throw new Error('handle not found')
  handle.addEventListener('mouseenter', onHandleMouseOver)
  handle.addEventListener('mouseleave', onHandleMouseOut)

  sortable(el, onSortStart, onSorted)

  // Drag operations don't remove :hover styles, so manage drag handle hover state.
  el.addEventListener('mouseenter', onListItemMouseOver)
  el.addEventListener('mouseleave', onListItemMouseOut)
}

       A demonstration we tested is also attached as a file.
