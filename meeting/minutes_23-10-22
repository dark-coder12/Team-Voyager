Tasks achieved since yesterday:

2 new issues closed (Login Security as well as JSON object parsing).

All team members are nearly done with their Unit Testing, which will be committed side by side.

I have started work on the first API Test too. Setup for Codecept js has been done:
npm install codeceptjs --save-dev
npx codeceptjs run

I was able to retreive data from GitHub using its API found on: https://docs.github.com/

I have also committed it under API Testing (Testing Branch) and have merged it with main.
