This piece of testing script is taken from the source: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/lib/gitlab/jira/dvcs_spec.rb

The mentioned test script is written in Ruby and below is the interpretation keeping in mind the testing and Ruby syntax.

1-a) encode_path_with_slash: The first test case tests the function encode_slash, in a way that this function is
passed a string path which includes the '/' character and after the successful execution of this function all
'/' characters are replaced with the '@' sign. To check the correct output an assertion is place in the form of `.to eq('a@b@c')`
to compare the expected result with the result retrieved.

1-b) encode_path_without_slash: In this part of the test case, the encode_slash function is tested for such a
path in which it does not include the '/' sign. So, for the proper functioning of this function it should not process
the path without slashes, and similarly, the assertion is put in a way that the resultant i.e.,`.to eq('foo')` should be same as the passed parameter path.

2-a) decode_path_with_slash: In this part the slashes are decoded, in other words the character which was replaced with
'@' at the place of '/' will be again replaced with slash. We can also think about this in a way that these functions are used for the storing the paths in an encrypted manner.

2-b) decode_path_without_slash: In this part, decode_slash function works in a way that if there exists a path without
slashes then the function will not look for any slashes rather the retrieved result would be same as the input 
parameter.
