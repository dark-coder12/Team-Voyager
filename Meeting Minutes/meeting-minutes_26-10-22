Having done simple Nightwatch Testing of our respective unit tests, we covered the following aspects today i.e 26th October's meeting)

  -> Going through the setup and documentation of Cucumber 
  -> Trying to understand the dynamics of Gherkin Language and automated Testing
  -> Incoperating env variables in all test cases
  -> Exploring the Page Object Model (we will be adding that in all our test cases and making the final commits soon).
  
  
 API Testing was further explored through GitHub's official website and while Shehryar and Bisma are working on Cucumber Setup, Izza is currently setting a base for
 all API Testing.
