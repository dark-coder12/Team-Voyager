Daily Meeting Report:

Venue: FAST NUCES 
Time: 3:30 to 4:00 pm

Agenda:
Trying out various ways to solve GitLab's Captcha issue.
Upon some barriers from GitLab, we explored GitHub and saw if it holds all similar test cases for which we've made test scenarios.
GitHub had many similar functionalities with just a little varied UI design or exact step process.
e.g Gist instead of Snippet.

Work division (completed at home):
Bisma wrote the login test case for GitHub.
Izzah wrote the gist creation test case (basic for now) to see if GitHub's security does not cause any issue.

Both test cases are working successfully (there was no restriction from GitHub) and have been committed to a new folder in this repository.

Prior work (21st): Setup by Shehryar and original test case writing of Merging Request for GitLab.
