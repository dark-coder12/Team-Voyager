A short online meeting was held today to discuss the progress as well as future tasks of Phase 2.

All Unit Testing was done and committed last week using simple NightWatch, but most of it has been integrated with Cucumber, and is being committed on the go.

About 50 % of API Testing has also been done, once it is added, assertions and code optimization will be added.

Documentation Branch was also created this week to cater Task 4 and Task 5. General Introduction on GitHub's most used APIs was committed and will be expanded upon.
